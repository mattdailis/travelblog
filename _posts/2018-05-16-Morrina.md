## A Boston Band with a German name came to Madrid

for the first time last night. *Vundabar* is a group of three guys from Greater 
Boston who have been touring for the past three months, all over the US and now
Europe. They had been my first concert, back at Great Scott in Allston, and 
Michelle and I were excited to go see them here.

Classes have been done for about a week now. The weather has improved, and the
workload has lessened, so all across the board life is getting better for UC3M
students. Those who have a long gap before their scheduled exams are taking
advantage of this time to travel. Joanna is in Copenhagen, with her Egyptian
boyfriend, and Bence went with a bunch of other Erasmus students down to Andalucia. 

Michelle has her Files and Databases exam during one of the earliest possible
final exam slots, so this weekend was spent studying. As a reward for all that 
studying, we made the questionable decision to go see *Vundabar*, who were here
playing as part of the San Isidro festival. 

San Isidro is the patron saint of Madrid. Thus, from the 11th to the 15th of May
the city is filled with parades and music. As we sat studying in our apartment
in Lavapiés, the sweet sound of *Zarzuela* singers (Spanish opera) floated in 
through the open window.

*Vundabar* knew none of this, though. They had arrived by car from Barcelona, 
exhausted and homesick. When we arrived two hours early for the concert by
mistake, we saw them playing an arcade game in the bar, looking like they were
trying to stay awake. We left the bar to spend the next two hours outside,
and ended up seeing the band again at Plaza del Sol:

The opener was called *Xavier Calvet*, from the easternmost edge of Spain, past
Barcelona. They spoke fluent Spanish, and sang fluent English. All of them had
very Catalan names. While they were playing, I approached Vundabar's drummer,
Drew McDonald, who was managing the merchandise table.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Hey man, how's it goin'? How much
for the CD?"

I opened. He gave me a look, too tired to be surprised at my New England mannerisms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Ten"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "You want dollars or euros?"

That question caught him by surprise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Uh, I guess dollars'd be easier if 
you have 'em."

I went on to ask him about how touring is going. He said that at this point
they're just trying to hold on to the end. I told him I was looking forward to his
set, and he just made a face at me.

A few songs in, the lead singer walked up to the mic, and began,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "¡Que bueno!"

He seemed to want to express something more though, so he continued,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Que..."

he dug for the word, not finding it. He tried again,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Que..."

the word wasn't coming, and he ended with a dejected

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "'kay..."

I felt for him so much then. Spanish is hard.

A few songs later, the drummer tried a different tack,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Tenemos una más"

which very clearly expressed that they had one more song to play. Then he kept
going

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Por el desayuno, yo bebo jugo de naranja"

"For breakfast I drink orange juice", using the American Spanish word for "juice."
We cheered him on through a few more Spanish sentences, until he faltered,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "It's because I care. I really care..."

We caught the guitarist and the bassist after the set, and both expressed 
relief to find someone from their hometown. 

## A peruvian man sat quietly in the shade

in *Tirso de Molina*, one of the hundreds of mini-plazas scattered throughout 
Madrid. He sat listening as two flamenco guitarists argued over the tempo
of their song, and tourists waited for their local friends, and some local men
lounged around smoking weed. He sat enjoying the relief the shade gave him on the 
warm May afternoon, holding all of his possessions in a small canvas bag. He
loved the music, and he longed for home.

Michelle and I had started the day at *100 Montaditos*, our regular Wednesday
lunch. We parted ways, she for her exam, and I to get a hard case for my 
new guitar. 

I raced to the *Jose Ramirez* guitar shop, knowing that if I wasn't careful, I
would get there during *siesta*, and nobody would be there to attend me.
Luckily, Isaac was there, and he helped me pick out and buy a guitar case. 

I strolled down the street happily laden with my guitar snugly secure in its 
new case. I wandered homeward, stopping by a newsstand to pick up today's
edition of *El País*. Something about Puidgemont - the ex-leader of Catalonia,
currently seeking asylum in Germany. I wandered into *Tirso de Molina*, looking
for a shady bench to sit and (try to) read the newspaper. The first one I tried
had a puddle of urine under it, so I kept walking. I was drawn to a pair of men
with guitars.

![Flamenco guitarists]({{ "/assets/flamencoguitarists.jpg" | absolute_url }})

The man in the hat was clearly a highly proficient flamenco guitarist, and he
was holding a blistering pace through his melodies. The accompanist with his
*rasqueados* (the quintessential flamenco strumming pattern) couldn't keep up,
and kept begging the other one to slow down. I laughed to myself as I settled 
down to read the newspaper. 

After a while, the pair packed up their guitars. As they did so, the accompanist
fielded some questions from a small man in a fedora. As the guitarists left, I 
pulled out my own guitar. The man in the hat sidled up to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "¿Tocas la guitarra tambien?"

I nodded and started tuning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Tócame algo de tu país"

I was stumped. I'm not the best at generating American music. I decided to play
what I'd studied with my guitar teacher instead. I started on "Capricho Arabe."
A few bars in, he nodded and told me that this song is from Andalucia in the
south of Spain. I asked him where he was from. "Perú" he replied. He told me
that he wants to go back, but that saving up the 500€ for the plane tickets
has been taking a while. He whistled along as I finished the tune.

I asked his name, he told me "Jesús." I introduced myself as "Mateo" as I always
do here, and he laughed, pointing out that we both have biblical names. He
offered to sing me a song of his home country, and I accepted, curiosity outweighing
caution as I handed over my guitar. 

He played me a song called *Marujita* by Jilguero del Huascarán. He clearly had
very little clue of what to do with a guitar, but he made a lively attempt of it,
pulling out a song that was popular in 1960, when he was 15 years old. His father
had died 5 years earlier, in 1955, forcing him to quit school after only 3 years
of education.

I asked him how long he'd been in Madrid. "Diez años," he told me. He'd been looking
for a job the whole time, but hadn't found one. "Tengo demasiado edad," he said. He
told me that everyone wants the young ones. 

He told me about his eight children. 5 in Madrid, 3 back in Perú. I don't like to
bother my daughters, he told me, that's why I go eat in the *comedor*.
[*Comedores*](http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?c=CM_InfPractica_FA&cid=1354249839089&pagename=ComunidadMadrid%2FEstructura)
are centers that provide basic daily food for people who "lack resources." He
mentioned that he really dislikes bothering people. That's why he doesn't go
begging for money. His pride stops him from doing that, and he expressed disdain
for people that do. 

Several times during our conversation he pointed to my phone, which was laying
beside me on my bench, telling me not to forget it. It occurred to me how
dramatically priviledged I was. I had just bought a new guitar case for 60€, and
I still had the old one resting under my feet. I had my Kindle in one pocket of my
cargo shorts, mp3 player, phone and wallet in the others. My newspaper cost enough
to get him a meal, and my guitar alone cost enough to buy him a flight home.
