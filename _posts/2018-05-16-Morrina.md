## A peruvian man sat quietly in the shade

in *Tirso de Molina*, one of the hundreds of mini-plazas scattered throughout 
Madrid. He sat listening as two flamenco guitarists argued over the tempo
of their song, and tourists waited for their local friends, and some local men
lounged around smoking weed. He sat enjoying the relief the shade gave him on the 
warm May afternoon, holding all of his possessions in a small canvas bag. He
loved the music, and he longed for home.

Michelle and I had started the day at *100 Montaditos*, our regular Wednesday
lunch. We parted ways, she for her exam, and I to get a hard case for my 
new guitar. 

I raced to the *Jose Ramirez* guitar shop, knowing that if I wasn't careful, I
would get there during *siesta*, and nobody would be there to attend me.
Luckily, Isaac was there, and he helped me pick out and buy a guitar case. 

I strolled down the street happily laden with my guitar snugly secure in its 
new case. I wandered homeward, stopping by a newsstand to pick up today's
edition of *El País*. Something about Puidgemont - the ex-leader of Catalonia,
currently seeking asylum in Germany. I wandered into *Tirso de Molina*, looking
for a shady bench to sit and (try to) read the newspaper. The first one I tried
had a puddle of urine under it, so I kept walking. I was drawn to a pair of men
with guitars.

The man in the hat was clearly a highly proficient flamenco guitarist, and he
was holding a blistering pace through his melodies. The accompanist with his
*rasqueados* (the quintessential flamenco strumming pattern) couldn't keep up,
and kept begging the other one to slow down. I laughed to myself as I settled 
down to read the newspaper. 

After a while, the pair packed up their guitars. As they did so, the accompanist
fielded some questions from a small man in a fedora. As the guitarists left, I 
pulled out my own guitar. The man in the hat sidled up to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "¿Tocas la guitarra tambien?" (You play guitar too?)

I nodded and started tuning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Tócame algo de tu país" (Play me something from your country)

I was stumped. I'm not the best at generating American music. I decided to play
what I'd studied with my guitar teacher instead. I started on "Capricho Arabe."
A few bars in, he nodded and told me that this song is from Andalucia in the
South of Spain. I asked him where he was from. "Perú" he replied. He told me
that he wants to go back, but that saving up the 500€ for the plane tickets
has been taking a while. He whistled along as I finished the tune.

I asked his name, he told me "Jesús." I introduced myself as "Mateo" as I always
do here, and he laughed, pointing out that we both have biblical names. He
offered to sing me a song of his home country, and I accepted, curiosity outweighing
caution as I handed over my guitar. 

[He played me a song]({{ "assets/jesus.wav" | absolute_url }}) called *Marujita* by Jilguero del Huascarán. He clearly had
very little clue of what to do with a guitar, but he made a lively attempt of it,
pulling out a song that was popular in 1960, when he was 15 years old. His father
had died 5 years earlier, in 1955, forcing him to quit school after only 3 years
of education.

I asked him how long he'd been in Madrid. "Diez años," he told me. He'd been looking
for a job the whole time, but hadn't found one. "Tengo demasiado edad," he said. He
told me that everyone wants the young ones. 

He told me about his eight children. 5 in Madrid, 3 back in Perú. I don't like to
bother my daughters, he told me, that's why I go eat in the *comedor*.
[*Comedores*](http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?c=CM_InfPractica_FA&cid=1354249839089&pagename=ComunidadMadrid%2FEstructura)
are centers that provide basic daily food for people who "lack resources." He
mentioned that he really dislikes bothering people. That's why he doesn't go
begging for money. His pride stops him from doing that, and he expressed disdain
for people that do. 

Several times during our conversation he pointed to my phone, which was laying
beside me on my bench, telling me not to forget it. It occurred to me how
dramatically priviledged I was. I had just bought a new guitar case for 60€, and
I still had the old one resting under my feet. I had my Kindle in one pocket of my
cargo shorts, mp3 player, phone and wallet in the others. My newspaper cost enough
to get him a meal, and my guitar alone cost enough to buy him a flight home.
