## We woke up in the morning and went to deliver the key to Rachael. 
This time she also left her phone at home.

For breakfast, we had pita at a *buregdzinica*. We walked to the end of Old Town,
past the old mosque where people in business suits were leaving their
shoes at the door, and took a cobblestone road that veered left and up the 
mountain. Dodging cars, we made our way straight up the mountain, past a
Cajhana and graffiti advertising the local soccer club. 

After a short while we came upon our first graveyard. What had looked like a
park on google maps was actually a grassy hillside covered in prestine 
white stone pillars with a square cross-section, ending in a point at the top. 
Each one marked a grave, and when we came closer we could see that none of the 
death dates were from before 1992. 

We followed the graveyard up the mountain, until we came upon the remains
of an old fort, called Zuta Tabija (Yellow Bastion). From there, we could
look out over the city. We could see many of these shiny graveyards throughout
the city. After a few minutes, we could hear the calls to prayer emanating
from various minarets which we spotted dotting the cityscape. The calls
echoed around through the valley, creating a wonderfully peaceful and beautiful
effect.

We forged onward, having been told that the next fort was a significant hike
away. We passed a preschool and several small, wooden mosques. The streets
got narrower, and the cars had to be more and more creative to pass each other.
As pedestrians, we took cover on porches or in garage doorways, where we felt
the cars would not reach us.

We made it to the top of the hill, where a stone gate barely wide enough for 
a car obscured our view to the northeast. We watched as a woman calmly ambled
through the gate, and decided to investigate what we could find on the other
side. After waiting for a suitable gap between the cars, we briskly walked
through the gate and were met with a view of a deep valley with some farms and 
a highway surrounded by mountains that reached for the sky. This place was 
called *Visigradskaja &#x2026; something*.

Our destination, *Bijela Tabija*, was another, bigger, run-down fortress with
a view. This one sits atop a cliff overlooking the *Mijelacka &#x2026;* River. The
wind buffeted us on the way to the entrance. Inside, we spotted a group of
arabic-looking women in head scarves, sporting nice pants and shoes. One of 
them was taking pictures as the other balanced on a narrow ledge of broken rock
wall that led from the center of the fort to the wall. She reached a window on
the wall, and to my surprise, began to clamber into it. The one taking pictures
slipped her phone into the folds of her outfit and too made her way to the wall.

Michelle and I looked at each other, and in unspoken agreement decided that if
that family of older women in unwieldy dress could do it, we had to try. We
followed suit, crouching low to keep our centers of gravity close to the
crumbling rock wall. We made it to the windows and peered through. Just outside
the window, the castle wall extended about two meters, and then suddenly ended.
Beyond the sheer edge, we could only make out the rocks and bushes of the 
countryside far below. Determined, we pushed ourselves through the window and
out onto the ledge beyond.

Sitting firmly on the window ledge, I felt a little drop in my stomach as I took
in the view. We took some cautious pictures, and made our way around the edge
of the castle, to the southwestern part that faced the city. From this high up,
the graveyards fade into the rest of the city, and the valley stretches as far
as the eye can see.

That night we went out with Rachael to a local bar that was done up to imitate
the "Cheer" bar from a TV show.
