title: ¡Encantado, Madrid!
---

> **Encantado** is the customary ending to an intruduction, used to mean "nice to
> meet you." It comes from the verb "encantar," most related to the English word
> "enchant." If you like something a lot, you can say "¡Me encanta mucho!"

## We touched down in Madrid as the sun was going down. 

We took the 24 hour airport shuttle, which for 5€ brings passengers from Miguel Barrajas airport to the Atocha train station, right in the middle of Madrid. Cursing our hefty baggage, we hiked up the Calle de los Medicos until we reached our street, Calle de los Tres Pesces. We ate dinner at a pizza place on the corner of our street, and went to bed.

The next day was orientation for international students. We found our way to the campus of *Universidad Carlos III de Madrid* (UC3M) without breakfast, and the presentation was pretty boring. We were, however, amused at our tour guide, named Carlos like the university itself, who got lost on the tiny campus. That night we went home and figured out our grocery store, called *Carrefour*. 

## The first week of school was a study in confusion.

I got up early and ran to the train station at 8, and got to school before 9. The
streets of Madrid are quiet and grey at this hour, with only street cleaners
milling about, picking up dog poop.

I walked briskly to campus, and passed the campus map without a glance, convinced
that the buildings would be somehow labeled, or at least arranged in a logical
way. Neither was true, so I spent a while milling about. I found room 4.01.E02
after some difficulty, since I also forgot about the European numbering system
for floors, and wing E jutts out at an angle to the rest of the building.

I found a seat near the window. The front row was vacant, since no one wants to
sit that close to the professor. Aside from me, there were maybe ten people. There
was no professor. We sat in silence for about ten minutes, communicating the minumum
amount necessary to allow people to reach their seats. After a while, we began to
get concerned: Were Spanish professors always this late? Someone went to ask on the
ground floor, and somewhere between their bad spanish, and the source's bad english,
gathered that all first period classes were cancelled. We decided, for lack of 
anything better to do, to introduce ourselves. I wrote everything down on the
first page of my notebook so I wouldn't forget. When my classmates noticed that I was writing about them, they came over to correct my mistakes.

### Matthis & Denis

are French boys from the northern city of *Rouen*. They spent a while helping me
pronounce it, but assured me that French people can't say it right either. Denis
wears an earring (a *boucle d'oreille*, as he coached me), a nose piercing, and
glasses. He responds to "Dennis" even though he calls himself "Deu-nee". He is
quiet at first, but clearly studious, and when he begins to make fun of you, he is 
hard to stop, as I learned to my mixed joy and dismay.

Matthis is a tall, thoughtful, bright, gamer kid who likes to joke about French
culture. His Algerian grandfather came to France when he was 6 years old, and 
thus Matthis knows a splattering of Arabic and fantasizes about Algerian
cookies at the end of Ramadan each year.

I ask Matthis how to say "Handwriting" in French, and when he struggles to find
the word, a voice pipes up behind us. "It's *écriture*". I turn around and ask
who's talking. 

### Arnaud

is a fun-loving and kind guy from Toulouse. He dislikes his home University,
and is looking to see if he can spend a full year in Madrid. He loves to dance in clubs and wear black lipstick, and while quiet and reserved in class, turned out to be incredibly friendly and talkative outside of campus.

### Joanna

pronounces her name "Yo-ahna" or Йоанна as I phoneticize in Russian. She is
from Poland. She is the most hard-working out of all of us, and her will 
would prove to be the force that pulled all of us through the class. Not only
smart, she is also the gutsiest of us, since she is the only one who actually
took a technical class in Spanish. 

When it becomes clear that the professor is not coming, a blond boy from the
end of my row calls to me, "Want to go get a coffee, Matt?" I didn't quite
catch his name when he told me, something like "Svad."

### Svenn, like the reindeer from *Frozen*

A blond boy who studies computer science and loves to play soccer and guitar - that description wouldn't be enough to distinguish between me and Svenn. He's from the northern town of Tromsø, Norway, and spent a good bit of his former life playing for a club soccer team and performing Johnny Cash covers. Now he leads a running team for his university, and experiments with cryptocurrencies. 

After meeting all my fellow Distributed Systems students (but not the professor!), the Security Engineering professor did arrive, so we went back to our seats and the semester officially began.
