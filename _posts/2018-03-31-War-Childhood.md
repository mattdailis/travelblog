## Saturday morning was a lazy one.
Rachael got up before anyone else
and showered, because she's been in the habit of getting up for work.

We eventually made our way to a cafe, where the only employee tried
to be hospitable through his distress. They brought me apple and 
cinnamon tea when I asked for caj. They did bring honey and lemon though.

Next, we went to have desert. I had a cappucino (but they used cream instead
of milk) and the girls each had a slice of cake.

We parted ways with Rachael, who went home to do some research. Michelle and
I went to the War Childhood museum. It was bittersweet (more bitter than
sweet, because of how awful the war was). Since the war was so recent,
many people who grew up during it are adults today. 

We went to the grocery store to buy dinner. I ate a lot of sudjuka.
