title: El Primer Mes

> **Mes** means "month." *Primero* means "first." Normally, adjectives in Spanish come after the noun. However, some may come before the noun, and those tend to lose their last vowel: hence "Primero" becomes "Primer"

## The first month of classes flew by quickly.

There were some clashes with a professor over his poorly translated quizzes, but otherwise I am very happy with all of my classes.

Within the first week, Michelle and I went to see a soccer game: Leganés (the city that housed our UC3M engineering campus) vs Sevilla (a large city to the South). This game was a particularly big deal because it was the farthest the *Pepineros* had ever gotten - tied for 3rd best team in Spain. The game itself felt like a high school football game, since everyone there knew each other and felt like a tight-knit community.

Over February we explored and made our own Madrid's central park: *El Retiro*. Located a stone's throw away from the central train station of Atocha, it is a favorite among locals and tourists alike. In good weather (which is to say, most of the time) it is bubbling with joggers and people working out, as well as roller skaters of all levels, some very impressive. On some days, the local *Pokemon Go* community comes out and plays in huge packs of 30 or more.

In its Northwestern corner is a large artificial pond full of boats, with a large monument to Alfonso XIII. We haven't tried going out in those boats yet, but we might when it gets warmer. This spot is on many Madrid postcards, and for good reason. 

Closer to its center is a *Crystal Palace*. Built for a world fair exposition, just like the Eiffel Tower, it remains as a pretty man-made counterpart to the natural beauty of the park. The pond in front of it is under maintenance, so we've been unable to appreciate the landscaping and design of this particular part of the park.

Crosswalks in Madrid have lights with varied pictures - some are your typical walking man. Others are a walking woman, walking pairs of men, pairs of women, a man and a woman together, a dog, a child, the list goes on and on. As Michelle learned in her Spanish-language communication class, these are the aftermath of a Gay Pride event in Madrid a few years ago, where they replaced all of the crosswalk signals with ones that showed the varied people of the city.

At school, I had made friends with the cafeteria ladies. During the first week of school I ate all my meals in the school Cafeteria (actually, I later learned that there are three of them). The way the meal system works is you pay a flat rate (5.20€) and you get a first course, a second course, a fruit or yogurt and a piece of bread. My first time, I accidentally took two main courses instead of a first and second course. I got to the cash register, and the lady there (who later introduced herself to me as "Rossy") tried to inform me that I had taken too much. I didn't understand at first, and she tried again, enunciating and gesticulating. I glanced back nervously at the long line that was waiting for me to finish. Rossy was good-natured about it though.

From that moment on, she took it upon herself to teach me Spanish. She introduced me to her friend Carmen who also worked the lunch line. Every time I would come back, they'd greet me with an excited shout, "¡Mateo!" and eagerly point at each food option and enunciate it for me. I noticed that the Spanish "gu" as in "yogur" is almost glottal such as to be almost not there (it sounded like yo-ourt to me). 

I also met a UC3M girl named Rocio there. She patiently let me struggle through a half-hour conversation in which we introduced ourselves and discussed our majors and plans for the future, as well as the importance of body language to interpersonal communication. That conversation exhilerated me - it was the first time I had held a full conversation in Spanish, and it gave me hope that I might learn enough to be able to express myself.

Last night we celebrated Svenn's birthday. I went for a run with him in Retiro, then he went to get a haircut. Over a dozen people of all stripes and nationalities packed into his apartment in the Embajadores region. There was an Argentinian boy named Jonny who studies translation and law. He gave me some valuable pointers about Spanish phonology. As he explained in a strong but very precise British accent, English has a lot of "plosives" - breathy consonants, while Spanish has very crisp short consonants. 

Michelle baked everyone a brownie cake, and an Italian named Lorenzo heated up frozen pizza for us. 

A highlight of the night was the gratitude that a Chilean girl named Javiera expressed to us for taking the time to learn Spanish. She explained to us that intercultural communication is crucial, and that if we do not take the effort to learn each other's languages, we stand no chance of learning about each other. This was a heartwarming reward for the effort we've put in to learn Spanish so far.
