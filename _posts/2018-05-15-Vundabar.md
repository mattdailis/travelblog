> **Vundabar** means "Wonderful" in German. It's also the name of a band from Boston.

## A Boston Band with a German name came to Madrid

for the first time last night. *Vundabar* is a group of three guys from Greater 
Boston who have been touring for the past three months, all over the US and now
Europe. Their style of music has been described as "explosive garage pop" - what I find most interesting about them is their creative use of dynamics and tempo in their music. That and the guitarist is sort of my role model when it comes to guitar, since he is able to do so much with only one guitar. They had been my first concert, back at Great Scott in Allston, and Michelle and I were excited to go see them here. 

Classes have been done for about a week now. The weather has improved, and the
workload has lessened, so all across the board life is getting better for UC3M
students. Those who have a long gap before their scheduled exams are taking
advantage of this time to travel. Joanna is in Copenhagen, with her Egyptian
boyfriend, and Bence went with a bunch of other Erasmus students down to Andalucia. 

Michelle has her Files and Databases exam during one of the earliest possible
final exam slots, so this weekend was spent studying. As a reward for all that 
studying, we made the questionable decision the night before Michelle's exam to go see *Vundabar*, who were here playing as part of the San Isidro festival. 

San Isidro is the patron saint of Madrid. I had stumbled into a museum named after him earlier this semester (I think the museum is built on the spot where his house used to stand). The museum told about the history of the Manzanares valley, and how it was peopled over time. I spent most of my time there struggling through the Spanish texts, once asking the guardlady to help me pronounce a tricky word. Thus, from the 11th to the 15th of May the city is filled with parades and music. As we sat studying in our apartment in Lavapiés, the sweet sound of *Zarzuela* singers (Spanish opera) floated in through the open window. People sporting masks and large painted heads mill the streets. 

*Vundabar* knew none of this, though. They had arrived by car from Barcelona, 
exhausted and homesick. When we arrived two hours early for the concert by
mistake, we saw them playing an arcade game in the bar, looking like they were
trying to stay awake. We left the bar to spend the next two hours outside,
and ended up spotting the band again at Plaza del Sol:

The opener was called *Xavier Calvet*, from the easternmost edge of Spain, past
Barcelona. They spoke fluent Spanish, and sang fluent English. All of them had
very Catalan names. While they were playing, I approached Vundabar's drummer,
Drew McDonald, who was managing the merchandise table.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Hey man, how's it goin'? How much
for the CD?"

I opened. He gave me a look, too tired to be surprised at my New England mannerisms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Ten"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "You want dollars or euros?"

That question caught him by surprise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Uh, I guess dollars'd be easier if 
you have 'em."

I went on to ask him about how touring is going. He said that at this point
they're just trying to hold on to the end. I told him I was looking forward to his
set, and he just made a face at me.

A few songs in, the lead singer walked up to the mic, and began,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "¡Que bueno!"

He seemed to want to express something more though, so he continued,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Que..."

he dug for the word, not finding it. He tried again,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Que..."

the word wasn't coming, and he ended with a dejected

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "'kay..."

I felt for him so much then. Spanish is hard.

A few songs later, the drummer tried a different tack,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Tenemos una más"

which very clearly expressed that they had one more song to play. Then he kept
going

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Por el desayuno, yo bebo jugo de naranja"

"For breakfast I drink orange juice", using the American Spanish word for "juice."
We cheered him on through a few more Spanish sentences, until he faltered,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "It's because I care. I really care..."

We caught the guitarist and the bassist after the set, and both expressed 
relief to find someone from their hometown. They both knew about Northeastern University (the band had played there some years ago). We left the venue satisfied with how the two worlds had met, and happy that we had provided some support to our Boston boys in a far-away country where they didn't speak the language. We felt like locals.
