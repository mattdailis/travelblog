> **Padres** literally means "fathers," but also means "parents." In Spanish, if there is a group of people or things of mixed genders, the masculine version of the word is used.

Early March started out with the UC3M [*T3CHFEST*](https://t3chfest.uc3m.es/2018/?lang=en). This was a Ted-talk style two-day event where the university hosted hour-long talks about topics in technology and computer science. Most of the talks were in Spanish, but a few were in English. I attended two Spanish-language talks, understood about 30% of what I heard, but I enjoyed the experience immensely.

One of the talks was "How to make your computer speak almost as well as Rajoy." Some background on that: Mariano Rajoy has been the prime minister of Spain since 2011. He is the head of the People's Party (*El Partido Popular*), one of four main political parties in Spain. The other ones are the Spanish Socialist Workers *Partido Socialista Obrero Español* (PSOE), United We Can (*Unidos Podemos*, usually shortened to *Podemos*), and the Citizens party (*Ciudadanos*). Rajoy is mostly known among the younger populace as the man who speaks in tongue-twisters. While we've been here, he's uttered the following riddle: 

> "I can assure you all I will do what I can and a bit more than what I can, if that is possible; and I will do everything possible and even impossible, if the impossible is also possible"

The talk covered Markov chains of words (the way your phone gives you suggestions for your next word) and the software generated phrases that were just as nonesensical.

Aside from *T3CHFEST*, our Software Development lab teacher threw a party in lab. He "hid" a cardboard box full of beer under the floorboards in the lab. 

International Womens' day came and went. There were large protests in the center of Madrid - organizers urged women to stay home from work (one of Michelle's professors cancelled class), and students to stay home from university (this didn't really make sense to us - how is it empowering to deny yourself education?).

We [took a trip to La Mancha]({{ "community/lamancha.html" | absolute_url }}) last week, and learned about the places of Don Quixote. 

My family came to visit me for my birthday. They arrived on Sunday and rented an apartment on the same street as us. We took them to [*El Rastro*]({{ "community/bulls.html" | absolute_url }}) - a market that happens in our neighborhood every Sunday year round. We wandered through the market while my mother bought herself some trinkets. We also took them to *Plaza Mayor*, a historical center of Madrid where everything from bull fights to public executions took place (not that those are altogether different things). 

On my birthday we [went to a Flamenco show]({{ "community/flamenco.html" | absolute_url }}) just a few blocks from our apartment. As we were walking back, we noticed that the recycling dumpster was a bit smaller than usual, smelled funny, and was billowing in black smoke. We looked up what had happened in the news later that night.

Our neighborhood, called *Lavapiés* after a fountain where people used to wash their feet, is one of the most diverse in Madrid. Restaurants line the streets serving ethnic food from India, Turkey, China. People live here from all over the world - *Carrefour*, the French supermarket chain where we get all of our groceries - is full of every language. There are, in particular, many immigrants from Senegal. Some of these immigrants don't have papers, and even the ones who go through the herculean effort of obtaining those papers have a tough time finding work. So most take the obvious solution - working without papers. 

One such paperless man was persued by the Spanish *Guardia Civil* (the cops) until he collapsed from a heart attack. This was the catalyst that protest groups were waiting for. Brandishing the flag against police brutality, they took to the streets, bashed up some cars, burned some dumpsters, and caused a lot of chaos. As a result we had a helicopter hanging over our neighborhood for two days straight. The radio lamented how Lavapiés had hitherto been a model of peaceful coexistence of many cultures, and now was in national news as a violent and unreasonable place.

To escape from all this, we took a day trip out to Toledo. It's a 40 minute train ride south of the city, in the same direction as our La Mancha trip. The city itself is medieval in construction, with narrow, steep, and windy streets. It's a city-fort, built with the river Tajo forming a natural moat on one side. We took a bus tour around the city, and despite the pouring rain got to see the stunning views down upon it from the neighboring mountins.

In Toledo we spent most of our time in museums, hiding from the rain. We learned about Spanish military history, as well as the artist *El Greco* who had a residence in Toledo.
