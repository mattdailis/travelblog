## As we walked along the water, we noticed the tile. 

At first it was subtle, "oh, what pretty tile! And over there too!" Then it came all at once. The façades of all the houses were covered in colorful tile. Blue! Orange! Yellow! Red! Green! All over the place, and in intricate designs. Some of them were thematic, depicting historical events or famous places, or the services offered in the building (ex: a hair salon showed a picture of a barber and his client). Others were more decorative, sporting artistic designs done in festive colors that gleamed in the sun.

We had spied a castle on top of a hill, and decided to make it our aim to reach the summit and look back down upon the city. We used the "hill-climbing" algorithm to find the top, always picking the street that looked like it would give us the most altitude. We climbed the steep and narrow medieval streets alongside trolleys and cars, past an old church, imaginative graffiti, and the remains of an old Roman theater:

It struck me that we truly were in Europe. You can find some pretty architecture in The States, but you'll rarely stumble across anything built more than a millenium ago. 

We reached the top of the hill, and after climbing all over the Castle Sao Jorge, splitting a ham sandwich for lunch (where a peacock blocked our way into the cafe) lay down on a bench to take relax in the sun.

We eyeballed the location of our hostel from above and set off down the windy roads to try to find it. Without getting terribly lost, we wandered our way to the door and up the stairs to the little front desk. We were greeted by a man named Joao, who excitedly showed us around. The common area was spacious, with separate dining room, TV room and kitchen. Our bedroom was shared by 4 other people. Michelle took top bunk while I took the bottom. We pushed ourselves to stay up until the sun went down a little after eight. After a quick pizza dinner, we went up to our bunks and went straight to sleep. Thus ended the longest day ever.

## Sintra!

The next day we got on a train as early as we could manage (9:40) and ended up in a town forty minutes from the center of Lisbon. After watching the hilly countryside flash by our windows, we noticed a large mountain start to block our the sky, with something that resembled the Great Wall of China splayed out on the crest of the mountain like a giant caterpillar. 

Sintra had been used for centuries (if not millenia) for its stratigic value as a lookout post. From its top, the Arabs, then the Romans, then the Portuguese, and at times the Spanish could look out and see the ocean to the West, the River Tejo to the Southeast, and farmland to the North. Every nation that has controlled this Southwesternmost tip of the Iberian peninsula has build and rebuilt something on this mountain, such that a tour of Sintra is a tour of the history of Portugal.

We started out near the bottom, at the National Palace. This was an edifice with two oversized smokestacks and a plain white façade. The smokestacks, we learned, were over a giant kitchen that was used to serve the royal family and the staff. Inside the building were thematic rooms lavishly decorated with art. Here, we found the most impressive tile yet. All of the nobles of the royal court were pictured in here, some preserved better than others. Some had been erased when they fell out of favor with the king. The tile depicted the King and the nobles going out on hunts.

Next, we grabbed sandwiches and hopped on a bus to the top of the mountain. The streets were so narrow windy it seemed a miracle that the bus didn't get stuck. We disembarked by the *Castle of the Moors*. What had appeared to be the Great Wall of China was actually an ancient castle build by some of the first settlers in the Iberian peninsula: the Arabs. It had been repaired and rebuild many times, as could be seen in the layers of stonework. We stood on the walls, buffeted by the wind, and drunk in the scenery which was among the most beautiful we had seen.

From the Castle of the Moors we walked through the woods to another castle: *Castle Pena*. This one was much more modern, covered in stunning colorful tile. We happened to be there at sunset, which made the sights all the more impressive.

We had dinner at the bottom of the mountain, where we tried their local tapas, which included seafood and sausages. We slept on the train back to town.
