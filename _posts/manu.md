## For the second time, I heard music coming through the window...
And this time I knew I would not pass up the chance. I grabbed my
guitar and schoolbag and raced down the stairs, across the stairs,
and up the stairs, and started putting my ear to each door I passed.

Backstory: Returned from Dublin, overslept alarm

Knocked and music stopped. Started again, rang, stopped again.

Wrote a note in childish handwriting with childish wording

Went to school, saw a flamenco musician, asked about CSE

Studied for Exam in Park

Text conversation with Manu

Exam (Aced)

After Exam, Michelle stayed to work on Databases, I went home, shaved and
went out

Found the bar, half-closed to show it's not open yet

Wandered in, found Manu, introduced myself

Walked to get batteries

Came back, met the rest of the band (Isaac, Kike)

Flora's entrance

Hanging out in the bar

Show

Hanging out in the bar, learning spanish (Que te cagas)

Home to Michelle, stayed up late finishing homework
