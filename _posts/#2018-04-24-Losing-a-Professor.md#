## This morning, we all gathered around the door
at 8:57, anxous not to miss the exam at nine. We had all been working hard until the 
deadline at midnight, and now we sleepily crowded the door, waiting for Manuel to come 
with the key.

The crowd parted to let through a man with a cane and a limping gait followed by a
young girl with green hair and a bearded man with a clipboard. The door opened, and
we filed in and chattily picked seats for the exam. The group quieted down as Manuel
began to speak.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Today is a sad day for our department, 
because one of our colleagues, Florin, passed away yesterday. Please, let's have a
minute of silence for him."

We all sat confused, unsure what to think, but he didn't seem to be joking. His eyes 
look strained, and his normally hard-assed demeanor seamed meekened. There was a 
rush at the door as a late student arrived, ready with excuses about how the train 
was held up. He stopped mid-sentence when he saw how gravely we sat. 

The minute ended with a round of applause. Manuel continued,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Obviously we are not in the mood to hold 
class this morning, and unless anyone has any objections we will have the exam in 
two weeks."

No one raised any objections, and as we filed out of the room, I found Davide, my 
homework partner. We met eyes and he grimaced at me, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "For once we were both on time."

We went to the cafe in the same building and sat at the Coca-Cola branded outdoor 
tables that had just been put in. 

Arnaud, my friend from Toulouse came up to our table with a shoulder bag, his eyes 
puffed up either from lack of sleep or from sadness. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "I overslept my, uh, awakening," he started,
reaching for the word for alarm clock and not finding it. I began to assure him that
the exam had not taken place, but he waved me off.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "I know - my partner told me last night
while I was working on my report. I was shocked, and I felt terrible as I finished
my report as though nothing had happened. I overslept, and didn't take my shower -
Great Day," he finished with a muted sarcasm and left to go buy some food from the *supermercado*. 

On a regular day, I might have gone with him, but today I want to get my thoughts 
down about Florin. 

![Florin]({{ "/assets/florin.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Florin was a soft spoken man with a hard to place, not quite Spanish accent. He was
the only professor who had asked me what university I was from, and he actually 
knew of the professor who had taught my operating systems class back in Boston.

He cared about teaching well - he was the only professor that customized his 
presentation slides and updated them throughout the semester. He was a fan of the 
Coursera style of teaching, where every few minutes during the 
presentation, he would provide us with a quiz question to either check our 
understanding of the material, or to get us thinking about the upcoming material.
Then, at the end of the lecture, he would present us with the full 10 question quiz
again, and would grade us based on that. 

Yesterday was no different from any other day. I brought breakfast into the
classroom, even though I knew it is considered rude in Spanish culture. He 
lectured from nine to ten about implementing access matrices in operating systems,
gave us the usual break halfway through, then spent a while detailing the
components of the IBM Blue Gene supercomputer. I tuned in occasionally, electing to
spend class working on the assignment that was due that night.

When class ended at eleven, I darted out to throw my coffee cup and wrapper
away, afraid he might leave and I might not be able to ask him my question before
it was too late (for the assignment). I came back into the room as he finished 
packing his bag.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \- "Professor, I have a question about the 
homework. Do you know how we should implement CRCs?"

He looked at me with a tired expression on his face, but his commitment to teaching 
prevailed and he patiently waited while I drew out my design on the board. He 
started to voice an objection about my design, thought better of it, and told me
that I should really ask Davide. I thanked him, and held the door as we left 
together. 

We walked side by side down the hallway, until I noticed he wasn't beside me
anymore. I turned to look, and he stood leaning on the bathroom door. He looked me
in the eye, gave me a tired smile and a little wave, and said "Bye."
