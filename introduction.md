## CEP Info

I am completing these two projects for the [Northeastern CEP](https://www.northeastern.edu/communityservice/programs/long-term-programs/civic-engagement-program/) because I spent the last 4 months abroad in Madrid, Spain.

>CEP stands for the Civic Engagement Program and is a program for students with various Northeastern-funded scholarships who participate in a mandatory program which requires students to complete 100 hours of service and civic engagement activities annually.

I lack **15.5 hours**, so I did two projects, worth 10 hours each. I put their descriptions below, which are excerpts from [the original document]({{ "assets/CoopAbroadDOC Projects 2017-18.pdf" | absolute_url }}) (Projects 4 and 6 highlighted in green).

### Project #4

>Attend and Participate in Community & Cultural Events. This project involves attending cultural events, community festivals, or arts programming and documenting the experience. 
>
>*Try to find events that represent the varied cultures in the area that you are residing in*
>
>To earn 10 hours, students should:
>
> Attend at least 4 events and provide information on the date and location, and sponsoring organization of each event.
> No two events can be similar in context (i.e. visiting two different memorials or seeing two separate opera shows) 
> Document the events both through written commentary and photographs. Each event description/commentary should be approximately 500 words. What did you learn at the event? What surprised you? Who else was at the event?

### Project #6:

>Keep a Travel Blog. This project is ideal for students who are abroad. Keep a journal or blog of your time abroad and keep up with it for the duration of your trip or program. 
>
>To earn 10 hours, students should:
>
>Write at least 10 blog or journal entries (at least 800 words each) throughout the duration of your trip or program reflecting on your experiences: include anything surprising or challenging as well as what you were doing and learning.
>
>Include at least 1 photo for every 2 blog/journal entries.

## Who and Why

I'm Matt Dailis - a third-year Computer Science student at Northeastern University in Boston. (That's me down at the bottom, taking a selfie in a *Renfe* train window - the Madrid equivalent of Boston's commuter rail). My girlfriend, Michelle, had been looking for an opportunity to study abroad for a long time. She finally decided to go to Spain this Spring and study at *Universidad Carlos III de Madrid* because they offered a large number of Computer Science classes. I was given the option to come along, and decided "Why not?" I had a thrilling semester learning the Spanish language and experiencing the Spanish culture. These projects tell the story of our adventure.
