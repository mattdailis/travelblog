The evening of May 25th, I sat in a bar an belted out songs in Spanish while my neighbor and 3 other musicians played on stage. Before I go on, let me tell you what events led up to this.

## For the second time, I heard music coming through the window...

And this time I knew I would not pass up the chance. I grabbed my
guitar and schoolbag and raced down the stairs, across the hallway,
and up the stairs, and started putting my ear to each door I passed.

We had just returned from [spending a weekend in Dublin]({{ "2018/04/15/Dublin.html" | absolute_url }}). We got back late Monday night, and Tuesday morning I overslept my Operating Systems Design practical session. I had a lazy day at home and tried to study for my Artificial Intelligence midterm that evening. Our kitchen window faces out into the inner courtyard, on the other side of which is the other half of our building. That's how I knew to run to the other staircase when I heard the music.

I could clearly discern a violin and a guitar, and maybe some voices as well. The other stairwell has many more apartments than ours, so it was tricky to decide which door to knock on. I finally narrowed it down to one, waited patiently for the end of a song, and knocked. 

Nothing happened. I knocked again. Still no reaction. I waited until the music started up again, and I rang the doorbell. The music cut off abruptly, and in the silence, I didn't hear anyone approaching the door. Getting desperate, I reached into my backpack and pulled out a notepad. I scrawled them a nice note in broken Spanish about how much I liked their music, and slipped it under the door. I left them my phone number as well. 

I took the train to Leganés, where my university is located. I went to a nice little park by the mental hospital where I could prepare for my midterm in peace. After an hour or so, my phone buzzed.

> (In Spanish) Hi Matt, I'm Manu, the violinist from the 2nd floor. I have a concert tonight. Would you be interested in coming?

I did a dance around the tree before writing my reply. He told me to meet him at *La Fídula* (*The Fiddle*), a bar and music venue a few blocks from our building.

That night, I arrived at *La Fídula* and stood waiting outside until they raised the half-lowered metal barrier that meant the place was closed. A few minutes later, I walked into the bar and introduced myself.

Manu greeted me like a long-lost friend. He asked me about myself, and we were able, somehow, to converse in Spanish, him feeding me words and me affirming or denying them. A few minutes later, his friend Flora came up.

Flora is a multi-faceted artist. She is a playwright, a comedian, and a singer-songwriter (possibly other things for which I didn't know the words in Spanish). She came up to Manu and told him that her neighbor had slipped a note under her door this morning thanking her for sharing her sweet voice with the building. After letting her finish, Manu told her that he too had received a note through the door. He introduced me to her, and from then on Flora became my personal Spanish tutor. She knew a good amount of English too, and when her mind wandered (which was every minute or two) would sometimes switch to it and then catch herself and switch back, apologizing profusely for breaking my immersion. 

As I met more people that night, I started to get the sense of this musicians' community. They all knew each other, all watched out for each other and collaborated on different projects, and they all came out to each other's concerts to show support. In a world where knowing the right person could be what gets you the gig, no wonder they were so eager to meet and mingle. 

The music was wonderful, I'll add some links at the bottom. The singer sang so clearly that I could almost follow the music. I wrote down many notes to look up later.

After the show, I thanked Manu for letting me into his world. He noticed my notes, and gave an excited shout when I told him what they were. He and Flora flanked me and started explaining each doubt I had. Flora taught me a vulgar phrase, "¡Qué te cagas!" which is used to mean "You were fucking awesome!"

From then on, we would come to *La Fídula* almost regularly to hear Manu play. He was the featured artist of the month in May, which meant he played there every Saturday night. I also found on Facebook that he and the band were playing one last show together in a different nearby bar.

Michelle and I went out there, and found ourselves surrounded by people who knew all the words to all the songs (even the bartender!). We sang along happily part of this musical family we had found.
