Flamenco is an art form that originated with the gypsy people in the South of Spain. It consists of tap dancing, sung poetry, music, and rhythmic clapping (sometimes with the aid of castanets).

I have long held a fascination for Flamenco music, having studied artists like [Paco de Lucia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyhlad64-s) in my classical guitar lessons back home. Back in Boston, I had gone to the House of Blues to see [Rodrigo y Gabriela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT9hvyDvKHA), which further piqued my interest in the genre. I was intrigued by the wandering melodies on top of intricate rhythms and percussive use of the guitar, especially the other-wordly strumming technique called *rasqueado*.

Thus, Flamenco was a must-see for me in Spain. I went to see it twice:

## A hometown show in Leganés

On February 17, the City of Leganés put on a Flamenco show at their community center. We found out about this through our Spanish classes for immigrants, and we happily made the commute to our university town on a Saturday to see this show. The demographic was grandparents and grandchildren, which was representative of the demographic breakdown of the city.

The show started with a long solo song by a dark man. He was the storyteller, and he began to tell about a city in the South of Spain where a girl was lonely. He stepped to the back of the stage, where the rest of the musicians stood just out of the spotlight, and the girl stepped into the light. She was dressed in a bright-colored dress and carried matching fans. With her hands held high she started stomping on the ground. The wood-soled shoes banged loudly against the hollow wood floor. She danced faster and faster, whirling around, and then returned to a slow stomp as a young man took the stage and began to dance around her. All the while, the narrator wailed, such that with my limited knowledge of Spanish I couldn't tell what he was saying. But the dancing and the music were pretty. 

When the show ended, we gave them a standing ovation, and someone brought the lead lady flowers. After everything was done, the actors on the stage started improvising. The lady started a clapping rhythm, which the crowd picked up, and the guitarist started dancing, though his soft shoes made a very soft tapping sound. We all hooted and cheered him on as the band and the dancers danced and curtsied their way off the stage.

## A Legit show in the center of Madrid

A couple blocks from our apartment, by *Tirso de Molina* is a restaurant/Flamenco venue called *Casa Patas*. When [my family came to visit]({{ "2018/03/20/a-family-visit.html" | absolute_url }}), they took me and Michelle out to dinner, and then we went to a late night Flamenco show. At 10pm we were ushered into the back room. It was dark, with a sloped floor and little round tables. We sat all the way in the back, against the wall, and watched the action unfold on the tiny stage. This time, there wasn't enough room for multiple dancers, so only one at a time twirled on the stage, narrowly avoiding the toes of the musicians. The dances were much more aggressive and the music was louder. There were three narrators who sang in turns, and clapped along. While impressive, I decided that I prefered the homier show in Leganés.
