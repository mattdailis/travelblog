Michelle and I donned our heaviest rain gear (which is to say, our usual light
jackets) and took the train to Leganés on a Saturday. We were to meet her Spanish class for a trip out to "La Mancha" - the countryside near Madrid.

Michelle and I have been taking Spanish classes for most of our time here. After the ones offered by the university fell through, I investigated the ones offered by the City of Leganés (El *Ayuntamiento* de Leganés). These turned out to be free, run entirely by volunteers, and incredibly good. In hindsight, it's also great that we took these because we met so many people who were not university students.

We met the class by the *Casa de Reloj* station (Clock house). We paid 3€ each (almost nothing, considering the full day of activities we were being provided with), boarded three busses (it was a combination of several classes, and many had brought their families) and rolled out into the rainy roads. We circled through town until we found a highway, and sped south.

The highways in Spain are free of advertisements, since the government had banned billboards on motorways. With one notable exception. The brandy called Veterano made its billboards shaped like bulls. These had become a familiar sight, and when the government tried to tear them down, there was resistance, and eventually they just painted them black and [let them stand](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/spains-roadside-bulls-live-to-fight-another-day-1439879.html)

We arrived at our first stop after two hours of beautiful countryside. We reached a Lagoon - the first significant body of water we'd seen in a long time. These lagoons are home to diverse wildlife - lots of birds. I'd tell you exactly what kind of birds, and about their mating habits and migration patterns, but all this information was conveyed to me in rapid Spanish as the presenter stood in front of the class. They took us up to a viewing platform to look over the Lagoon - and at that moment, the heavy rain struck. We scurried to find shelter in their house, which was clearly designed for sunshine. For the next half-hour, a hundred immigrants huddled in the open plan house, making small talk in broken Spanish.

The signal propagated through the class - Time to Go! We waddled out into the dirt road, trying not to step into puddles, emboldened by the prospect of lunch. We arrived at a restaurant that offered us shelter and food. We hung our wet things on our chairs, and began to socialize. I learned that some had come here to pursue higher education, others (the majority) are here as *au pères*. No one had a steady job - representative of the general unemployment of the country. We talked over bread and wine until the main course arrived, and what a main course it was:

*Paella* is a Spanish rice dish, made in a special pan, mixed with vegetables and *mariscos* - shrimp, mussels, chicken, and whatever else they feel like tossing in. It's labor-intensive to make, and is usually made in one large batch for many to share. The last, magic touch is to squeeze out a fresh lemon onto the rice. My mouth is watering as I write this. It was delicious.

They also served us a more local dish called *Pisto Manchego*. This dish had originated in Castilla La Mancha, and it consists of a mush of tomato, eggplant, and other vegetables. 

Our trip coordinator, Rosa, had grown up in La Mancha, and she led the other locals in a round of song. They also performed a scene from Don Quixote for us. Lastly, they invited immigrants to come up and sing a song from their country. We heard songs from Ukraine, China, France, and several more.

Happily fed, we boarded the busses again and headed out to see some of the old windmills that still stand on the hilltops in La Mancha. A flash rainshower forced us to hide in one and wait it out.

At the end of the day, we felt enriched by the experience - we had learned not only about the local culture, but about the cultures of our fellow immigrants, and enjoyed some great food (all for 3€, I might add).
