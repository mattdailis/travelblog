Several Sundays during our stay in Madrid, we would make it out to *El Rastro*, a street market a few blocks away from our building. Historically, this was the path that dead cows were transported along from the slaughterhouse to the tannery (*rastrar* means "to drag", so *el rastro* is the trail along which something is dragged), so the tradition of leather in this neighborhood goes way back. Today, the market still sells leather, but also anything else imaginable. From books, to touristy souvenirs, to guitars, to *Paella* pans and power tools.

A few other fixtures of the market are the musicians. The street that the market is on is a fairly steep hill near the top of which a group of musicians plays exciting medleys of popular songs, always surrounded by a crowd. Sometimes members of the crowd join in to sing and dance, sometimes even coming into the center of the circle to show off some dance moves. 

*El Rastro* is also a place to display some political signs, although the audience there is, in summer months, largely made up of tourists. In this picture, the sign says "They separate us and make us fight." The word "torear" comes from the word for bull - they make us fight as though we were bulls. This is a very Spanish word choice.

Following the theme of bulls, we also made it out to the *Las Ventas* bullfighting ring, to learn some more history about this Spanish pastime. 

The tradition of bullfighting goes back to the Arabs. At first, bullfighting was done exclusively on horseback. Then, one man decided to face the bull on foot, and from then on the sport changed. 

There are many forms of bullfighting. The most famous variety is called *corrida de toros* or "running of the bulls." In a traditional corrida, three matadors each fight two out of a total of six fighting bulls, each of which is at least four years old and weighs at least a thousand pounds. There are three parts to a bullfight.

In the first part of the bullfight, the matador assesses the bull, looking for weeknesses, all the while putting on a show for the audience as he waves his purple and yellow cape around, trying to convince the bull to charge at it (and only at it). This part is the most humane, and in my opinion the only part of the bullfight that I could stomach. Then enter the lancers on horseback that stab the bull in the neck to weaken and focus it on the fight. Historically, the bull would usually kill the horses, however at some point they decided to clothe the horses in heavy padding to protect them.

The second part is where *banderilleros* on foot try to anger the bull by placing barbed sticks into its back. This is supposed to make the bull be more aggressive.

The third part is the most dramatic, in which the matador dances with the bull, and then strikes the final blow.

All of this sounds emotionally scarring to me, so we decided not to stay for the bullfight at 7pm that night. Instead, we wandered the stadium museum, which had showcases of bullfighter clothes and swords, and some severed heads of particularly notable bulls. We got to see the inside of the stadium as well, which was a large arena with concrete seating (they sold seat cushions outside, which we figured would be absolutely necessary).

We also got to experience part of a virtual reality bullfight, which was really fun.
